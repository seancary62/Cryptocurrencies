# Cryptocurrencies
Using unsupervised machine learning to find crypto trends. This will begin as a class project, but I may try to refine it for my own use.

Through the module we used techniques like K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering to categorize data. We used tools like elbow curves to determine the right number of clusters to use, and hvplot to create 3D scatter plots of the data.
